			<h1> Elephanta Caves  </h1>
			<p><b>The Elephanta Caves is also called Gharapurichi Leni, located on Elephanta Island in Mumbai, Maharashtra. The whole cave temple complex area is about 60000 sq ft and  boasts of the central chamber, two lateral ones, many subsidiary shrines, and courtyards. Also, there are three passages to the temple complex. The entire location is built from solid natural rock with intricately carved sculptures of idols.

There are principally seven caves where one can investigate the real excellence of ancient Indian architecture. There are a few highly-finished rock surfaces in Elephanta Caves; however, some are the stark untreated rocks too. The most prominent expression of sculpted caves can be noticed in the two major groups of caves here.

The first cave represents engravings based on Hinduism, where you will find rock cut stone sculptures, dedicated to Lord Shiva. On the sculpture, you'll see quintessential essence of the Shiva Lingam created in eight manifest forms that are worth viewing.

Further, when you head to other smaller caves, you will witness that it’s an example of the Buddhistic rock-cut architecture. So, visit to this site is not about seeing the architecture marvel but also it’s your way to know Indian culture more deeply.

Elephanta Caves were assigned as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the year 1987. Thus, it is a notable site visited by many tourists during their trip to Mumbai to explore the historical and spiritual marvels here. Also, every February, the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) hosts a fantastic dance festival at Elephanta Island.
