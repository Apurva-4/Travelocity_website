			<h1> Hanging garden</h1>
			<p><b>Part of the Hanging garden complex in Mumbai, Kamla Nehru Park is a recreational ground, covering almost 4 acres of land area. The Malabar Hills are decorated with these exquisite gardens which are under maintenance by the local civic bodies in the region. The Kamla Nehru Park is highly popular with tourists and children, who love to come here and enjoy the scenic views of the city.<br>

One of the most notable views from this location is that of the Marine Drive, which gives a splendid view of the famous ‘Queen’s necklace’ from this point. Within the garden, a remarkable shoe structure can be found that draws the attention of children.
The park was renovated in the year 2017 and 2018 and was later opened to the public on 22nd February 2018. The park now has many additional spaces for the enjoyment of children. The refurbished shoe structure is now painted in blue, has a rainbow amphitheatre, a pergola with hanging cane chairs, Echo Gazebos, Compass View gallery, Minions selfie point, Ashoka Stambha with tricolour planter beds, and a clock.
